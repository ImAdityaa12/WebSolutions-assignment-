# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project involves creating a professional and responsive website that demonstrates proficiency in modern web development technologies. The website will feature multiple pages with dynamic content, form handling, and a clean, modern design. The solution must showcase frontend skills (HTML, CSS/SCSS, JavaScript), data handling (JSON), and backend integration (PHP), with optional database functionality for enhanced data persistence.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want to navigate through a multi-page website with a professional design, so that I can easily access different sections of content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I visit the website THEN the system SHALL display at least 4 pages (Home, About, Services, Contact)
2. WHEN I navigate between pages THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent navigation and design
3. WHEN I view the website on different devices THEN the system SHALL display a responsive layout that adapts to screen size
4. WHEN I interact with the website THEN the system SHALL provide a modern, professional visual design

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want to see dynamic content that loads from structured data, so that the website feels interactive and data-driven.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I visit any page THEN the system SHALL render content dynamically using JSON data sources
2. WHEN content is loaded THEN the system SHALL parse and display JSON data appropriately for each page section
3. WHEN I navigate to the Services page THEN the system SHALL display service information loaded from JSON data
4. WHEN I view dynamic content THEN the system SHALL handle data loading gracefully with appropriate fallbacks

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want to submit information through a contact form with validation, so that I can communicate with the website owner reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the Contact page THEN the system SHALL display a functional contact form
2. WHEN I submit the form with invalid data THEN the system SHALL display appropriate validation messages using JavaScript
3. WHEN I submit the form with valid data THEN the system SHALL process the submission using PHP backend
4. WHEN form validation occurs THEN the system SHALL check required fields, email format, and other relevant constraints
5. WHEN I submit a valid form THEN the system SHALL provide confirmation of successful submission

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the codebase to be well-structured and maintainable, so that the code demonstrates professional development practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the code THEN the system SHALL use SCSS for all styling with organized, modular structure
2. WHEN examining the codebase THEN the system SHALL include clear documentation and comments
3. WHEN analyzing the file structure THEN the system SHALL follow logical organization with separation of concerns
4. WHEN reviewing JavaScript code THEN the system SHALL implement clean, readable functions with proper error handling
5. WHEN examining PHP code THEN the system SHALL demonstrate basic backend integration with proper security practices

### Requirement 5 (Optional - Bonus)

**User Story:** As a website administrator, I want form submissions to be stored in a database, so that I can manage and review submitted information persistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a valid form is submitted THEN the system SHALL store the data in an SQL database
2. WHEN database operations occur THEN the system SHALL handle connections and queries securely
3. WHEN storing form data THEN the system SHALL include appropriate data validation and sanitization
4. WHEN database errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully without exposing sensitive information
